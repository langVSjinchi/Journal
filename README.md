		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 
		</p>
		<ul>
		 <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
		 <li>Magic city, ID</li>
		 <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
		 <li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
		 <li>Why, AZ</li>
		 <li>Truth or Counsequences, NM</li>
		 </ul>

	  <p>I saw some Burma shave style signs on the side of the road today: <q>passing cars, when you can't see, May get you, A glimpse,
		 of eternity.</q> I definitely won't be passing any cars.

	  <p> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to 
			bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipad, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
